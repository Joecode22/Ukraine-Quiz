## Credits

- The README for this project incorporates text from the project challenge assignment README from class.
- The quiz questions come from material on wikipedia about the Russian war in Ukraine:
- "Battle of Mykolaiv.” Wikipedia, , last updated 15 March 2023, <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mykolaiv&action=history>
- "Battle of Kherson.” Wikipedia, , last updated 27 March 2023, <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Kherson&action=history>
- During the creation of this quiz I followed along with a course on creating quiz apps taught by James Q Quick on YouTube. His channel can be found here: <https://www.youtube.com/@JamesQQuick> and the series of videos entitled 'build a quiz app' can be found here: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx>
- I was able to stop following the tutorial about halfway though then added additional functionality like the timer and the high scores table on the high scores page.
- I was also able to customize the questions in the questions array and choose my own styling.
